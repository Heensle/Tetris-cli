Tetris
======

A rendition of Tetris on the command line.

This is my final project for my C++ course, made over the course of about a week and a half.

Concepts I learned on this project:
- Ncurses library & related terminal concepts
- the difference between the istream and ostream
- how output and input are flushed
- game loops
- frame based graphics rendering
